Hello, my name is Sullykin. I develop Python games and utilities for fun.
I'm currently learning C++ and will hopefully add many more languages to my toolbox soon.
I'm also currently in the process of getting my Bachelor's degree in computer science.
Despite being a student, I have plenty of time and motivation to work on projects, so if you
would like to collaborate on something, send me a message on Discord (Sullykin#0431).
